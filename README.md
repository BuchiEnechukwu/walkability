## Walkability Analysis in Edinburgh Using OpenStreetMap and R

This project presents a geospatial analysis of walkability in Edinburgh, Scotland, utilizing OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and R programming. The study aims to assess pedestrian accessibility and infrastructure, providing insights into urban planning and public health implications.

# Project Overview
	•	Objective: To evaluate the walkability of Edinburgh by analyzing pedestrian pathways, amenities, and infrastructure using OSM data.
	•	Tools & Technologies:
	•	Data Sources: OpenStreetMap
	•	Programming Language: R
	•	Key Libraries: osmdata, sf, tidyverse, leaflet, igraph, osrm

# Methodology
	1.	Data Acquisition:
	•	Retrieved OSM data for Edinburgh, focusing on pedestrian-related features such as footways, crossings, and amenities.
	2.	Data Processing:
	•	Utilized the osmdata package to extract relevant geospatial data.
	•	Processed and cleaned the data using sf and tidyverse packages to prepare for analysis.
	3.	Walkability Assessment:
	•	Developed composite indicators to measure walkability, considering factors like sidewalk availability, intersection density, and proximity to amenities.
	•	Employed network analysis using igraph to understand connectivity and accessibility.
	•	Conducted routing analysis with osrm to estimate walking times to key destinations.
	4.	Visualization:
	•	Created interactive maps using leaflet to display walkability scores and highlight areas with varying levels of pedestrian accessibility.

# Key Findings
	•	Identified neighborhoods with high walkability scores, characterized by dense networks of footpaths and close proximity to amenities.
	•	Highlighted areas lacking pedestrian infrastructure, suggesting opportunities for urban development and policy interventions.
	•	Demonstrated the effectiveness of combining OSM data with R for urban walkability studies.

# Repository Structure
	•	01_OSM_data.Rmd: Script for downloading and processing OSM data.
	•	02_composite_indicators.Rmd: Development of walkability indicators.
	•	03_routing.Rmd: Routing analysis to assess accessibility.
	•	Data_Mobility_Infrastructure_project.Rmd: Comprehensive report compiling all analyses and findings.
	•	data/: Directory containing processed datasets and intermediate files.

# Future Work
	•	Incorporate temporal data to assess changes in walkability over time.
	•	Expand the analysis to include other cities for comparative studies.
	•	Integrate additional data sources, such as traffic patterns and public transportation networks, to enrich the analysis.
